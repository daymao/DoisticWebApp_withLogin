# TaskList_Finalized
This is a website in which you can create an account and login to the account in which you may create a list for something like 
groceries or school and you can add tasks to that list. You can also click on tasks that are completed and they will change to indicate 
that they are completed. You can clear completed tasks and remove lists that you no longer want. The lists are currently stored in the 
local storag of your web browser with JSON. The frontend was made with vanilla javascript and the backend for the login system was 
made using Express, and Node.js. The users account information are stored in a local variable inside the server instead of a database. 
The passwords are protected using hash from bcrypt. I also styled the webpage to look nice and smooth to use and I use this app for 
my daily planning.
