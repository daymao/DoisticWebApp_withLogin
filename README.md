# TaskList_Finalized
This is a website in which you can create an account and login to the account in which you may create a list for something like 
groceries or school and you can add tasks to that list. You can also click on tasks that are finished and they will change to indicate 
that they are finished. You can clear finished tasks and remove lists that you no longer want. The lists are currently stored in the 
local storage of your web browser as JSON. The frontend was made with vanilla javascript and the backend for the login system was 
made using Node.js and Express(with the passport system). The users account information are stored in the local storage of their
web browser so a multiple accounts can be created and accessed from a single computer. I styled the webpage to look nice and smooth 
to use and I use this app for my daily planning. 
*Note: This webpage is the same that I have in the TaskList repository but this one has a server and login system. The other version
in my repository is just the task list website without the login system.
